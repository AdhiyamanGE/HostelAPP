# HostelAPP
Hostel App is a web-based application tailored for  hostel students, aimed at easing parental consent processes for outings. Students can log in to access their profile, fill out an outing request form, which is then emailed to their parents for approval. Parents can respond via email, and the approval status is updated in the student's profile. The app displays student details and current pass status for security clearance, with a history page tracking all past outing permissions.
